# Intro

My personal extensions to the [Cockpit Project](https://github.com/cre4ture/cockpit)

- BTRFS Scrub and Balance Status
- Readable BTRBK Snapshot List
- S.M.A.R.T Disk Data Status

As those extensions are currently used only by myself, they might contains specific parts to my system (paths, names, ...).
But if you like to use them for your usecase, you should be able to easily adapt these.
I'm also happy for Pull Requests that improve these aspects.
